        "## Learning outcomes\n",
        "* You will learn how to download a pre-trained model and a training dataset from Hugging Face.\n",
        "* You will learn how to fine-tune the downloaded model with the dataset using Hugging Face trl library and the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method.\n",
        "* You will learn how to use the fine-tuned model to generate text based on user input / prompts.\n",
        "* You will learn how to upload the fine-tuned model to your own Hugging Face repository so that it can be used later or shared with other users.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequistes\n",
        "* You will need the following free accounts: Google, Hugging Face and Weights & Biases. You may use your existing accounts or create new accounts for the purposes of this course.\n",
        "* We will use the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) libraries: transformers (for models), datasets (for datasets), trl (for training). We will also store the fine-tuned models in a Hugging Face repository.\n",
        "* Training is done using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides free access to Jupyter notebooks backed with a GPU compute required for fine-tuning.\n",

Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Decreasing the amount of waste that is produced, finding new uses for items that would otherwise be thrown away, and properly recycling materials can help reduce pollution.\\n\\n2. Use Public Transport or Carpool: By using public transport or carpooling, you can significantly reduce your carbon footprint and help decrease emissions that contribute to air pollution.\\n\\n3. Conserve Energy: Simple actions like turning off the lights when you leave a room, unplugging electronics when not in use, and using energy-efficient appliances can help reduce your energy consumption and decrease pollution.\\n\\n4. Reduce Water Waste: Fixing leaks, taking shorter showers, and being mindful of water usage when doing household chores such as washing dishes or laundry can help reduce water waste and pollution.\\n\\n5. Use Green Products: Choose cleaning products and personal care items that are made from environmentally-friendly ingredients to help reduce pollution.\\n\\n6. Plant Trees: Trees are natural air filters that can help reduce pollution by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.\\n\\n7. Support Renewable Energy: Support the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, which produce less pollution than traditional fossil fuels.\\n\\n8. Educate Others: Spread awareness about the importance of reducing pollution and encourage your friends, family, and community to take actions to help protect the environment.'"

            "Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if one object exerts a force on another object, then the second object will exert an equal but opposite force back onto the first object. The mathematical representation of Newton's Third Law can be expressed as F1 = -F2, where F1 represents the force exerted by the first object, and F2 represents the force exerted by the second object. In this equation, the magnitude of the forces are equal in absolute value, but they act in opposite directions. Therefore, the total force acting on each object remains zero; hence, the system experiences no net force. This principle is fundamental to understanding how objects interact with each other in physical systems. It is crucial in fields such as physics, engineering, and everyday life, particularly when dealing with interactions between objects or bodies in motion.Human Resources Management System (HRMS) : A Human Resource Management System (HRMS) refers to a software application designed to manage various aspects of human resource management within an organization. These include recruitment, employee records, payroll processing, benefits administration, training and development programs, performance evaluations, and compliance reporting.
